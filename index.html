<p>Journalists, activists, and others who need to pass secret messages to prevent interception and decoding by third parties can use Text-to-bitmap to create images that look like random static. The images created are small and can often be hidden in plain sight as part of a larger image (steganography.)</p>

<p>Text-to-Bitmap turns regular text into a scrambled-looking image that can only be decoded with the correct password. Decoding with the incorrect password gives garbage data or false positives.</p>

<a name="how-to-use-the-tool" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use-the-tool"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use the tool</h5>

<p>Text-to-Bitmap has an API and a command-line tool, both of which can encode text and decode images.</p>

<p>For a demo of the API (no programming necessary), see <strong><a href="http://shannonturner.github.io/text-to-bitmap/api.html">http://shannonturner.github.io/text-to-bitmap/api.html</a></strong> </p>

<p>For the command line tool, run <strong>python uni_text_to_bitmap.py</strong> at the terminal to see the full usage details.</p>

<h5>
<a name="how-the-tool-works" class="anchor" href="#how-the-tool-works"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How the tool works</h5>

<p>Text-to-Bitmap is primarily used to encode a message into a small scrambled-looking image. Text-to-Bitmap can encode messages in any language.</p>

<p><strong>Alice</strong> will encode her secret message and send the scrambled image to <strong>Bob</strong>.  They can use a pre-agreed-upon password, or Text-to-Bitmap can automatically create a secure new password for each image.</p>

<p>Either way, when <strong>Bob</strong> has both the scrambled image and password from <strong>Alice</strong>, he can use Text-to-Bitmap to decode the image and receive the message.</p>

<p>If <strong>Eve</strong> intercepts the image, she might attempt to crack the code -- but will most likely be frustrated; each image created by the API has <strong>7,132,766,847,673,865,645,550,849,603,057,000,000</strong> possible passwords. Attempting to decode the image with an incorrect password will either fail outright or worse for <strong>Eve</strong>, give a false positive result.</p>

<p>Beyond simple messages, Text-to-Bitmap can also encode photos, videos, documents, or any other type of file and turn it into a scrambled image. </p>

<p>Included with Text-to-Bitmap is a command-line tool to test the strength of the encoded images by systematically trying to break the code.</p>

<p>Using the tool, even running <strong>100 trillion attempts per second</strong> would take <strong>22,602,374,222,608,400 years</strong> to crack the code.</p>

<p>If you'd like to try to crack the code, see <strong><a href="http://shannonturner.github.io/text-to-bitmap/challenges.html">http://shannonturner.github.io/text-to-bitmap/challenges.html</a></strong> for challenges.</p>

<p>Text-to-Smiley hides a short message in an existing small image of an emoticon by altering the colors imperceptibly. Because the emoticons look identical to the original identicons, Text-to-Smiley's strength is in hiding messages in plain sight (steganography).</p>

<p>Text-to-Smiley is limited to encoding very short messages.</p>

<p>Text-to-Smiley is in the early stages of development and should not yet be used for protecting secret messages.</p>
